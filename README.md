# Computational Design
**About me:**
  Hi, my name is Carmen and I am a Computational Designer at Foster and Partners in London.
  
  In my free time, I model complex parametrical geometries and develop components for Grasshopper and Rhinoceros.

**I am most skilled in:**
Grasshopper, Python, C#, Dynamo, Rhinoceros, Revit

## Projects
### Contour Curve Processing for CNC Models
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/ContourCurveTopographyProcessing)

This tool offers a systematic approach to transform CAD contour data into actionable and precise digital models. This has been particularly beneficial in preparing files containing a large volume of topography data for the creation of contour-stepped models through CNC machining. 

### Urban Dynamics: Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Understanding Contemporary Cities. Learning from Airbnb data

BArch Thesis. This research project explores  artificial intelligence and big data for urban analysis through the study of Airbnb data from three case studies: Madrid, Berlin, and Chicago.

### Differential Growth Simulation
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/Differential-Growth)

Differential growth is when different parts of an organism grow at varying rates or directions, altering its form. Through procedural generation, this algorithm simulates the growth of organic structures. This method allows the creation of highly realistic environments in computer graphics. This script simulates differential growth patterns in a mesh using Kangaroo Physics.

### Urban Grid Tools
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/Urban-Grid-Tools)

A set of tools in Python for Grasshopper to generates urban grids.

### Plot Fit  
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/PlotFit)

This script implements a method for placing building assets along a curve. It maximizes the number of assets positioned along a curve running a test fit through a loop of physical collisions.
