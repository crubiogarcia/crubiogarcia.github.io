# Computational Design
**About me:**
  Hi, my name is Carmen and I am a Computational Designer in the Architecture team at Foster and Partners in London.
#### I am most skilled in: Grasshopper, Python, C#, Dynamo, Rhinoceros, Revit

## Projects
### Contour Curve Processing for CNC Models
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/ContourCurveTopographyProcessing)

This tool offers a systematic approach to transform CAD contour data into actionable and precise digital models. This has been particularly beneficial in preparing files containing a large volume of topography data for the creation of contour-stepped models through CNC machining. 

### Differential Growth Simulation
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/Differential-Growth)

This script simulates differential growth patterns in a mesh using Kangaroo Physics for collision simulation and Anemone for looping.

### Fitting Blocks along a Curve
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/Differential-Growth)

This script simulates differential growth patterns in a mesh using Kangaroo Physics for collision simulation, looped with Anemone
