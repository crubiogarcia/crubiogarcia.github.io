# Computational Design
**About me:**
  Hi, my name is Carmen and I am a Computational Designer in the Architecture team at Foster and Partners in London.

**I am most skilled in:**
Grasshopper, Python, C#, Dynamo, Rhinoceros, Revit

## Projects
### Contour Curve Processing for CNC Models
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/ContourCurveTopographyProcessing)

This tool offers a systematic approach to transform CAD contour data into actionable and precise digital models. This has been particularly beneficial in preparing files containing a large volume of topography data for the creation of contour-stepped models through CNC machining. 

### Differential Growth Simulation
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/Differential-Growth)

This script simulates differential growth patterns in a mesh using Kangaroo Physics for collision simulation and Anemone for looping.

### Urban Grid Tools
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/Urban-Grid-Tools)

A set of tools in Python for Grasshopper to generates urban grids.

### Plot Fit  
[Repository](https://github.com/crubiogarcia/PlotFit)

This script maximizes the number of assets fitted along a curve using a loop (of physical collisions.
